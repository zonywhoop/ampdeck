## Requirements

- Any [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/stream-deck) model (Stream Deck+ recommended for the full experience)
- [Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/) running on the same network
- A [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/) with your music library

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/rackemrack/ampdeck/releases) page
2. Extract the zip
3. **Close Stream Deck completely**

**Windows:**

4. Double-click **`install.bat`**

**macOS:**

4. Open Terminal, navigate to the extracted folder, and run:
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
   ```

5. Start Stream Deck

## Updating

Updates use the same process as a fresh install — the installer replaces the existing plugin files automatically. Your settings (server URL, token, client name, etc.) are preserved.

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/rackemrack/ampdeck/releases) page
2. Extract the zip
3. **Close Stream Deck completely**
4. Run `install.bat` (Windows) or `./install.sh` (macOS) — same as initial install
5. Start Stream Deck

That's it. No need to remove the old version first.

## Setup

1. Find **Ampdeck** in the actions list on the right side of the Stream Deck app
2. Drag **Album Art** to any button
3. Drag **Now Playing Strip** to all 4 dials
4. Optionally drag **Play/Pause**, **Previous**, **Next**, **Shuffle**, **Repeat**, **Track Info**, or **Time Elapsed** to buttons
5. Click any Ampdeck action and configure:

### Connection Settings

Ampdeck connects to both your local Plexamp player and your Plex server:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Player URL** | Your Plexamp player address. Defaults to `http://localhost:32500` for headless Plexamp. Desktop users may need a different port — check Plexamp's settings. |
| **Server URL** | Your Plex server address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:32400`) |
| **Plex Token** | See [Finding Your Plex Token](#finding-your-plex-token) below |
| **Client Name** | Your computer's name as it appears in the Plex dashboard (used for server fallback) |

Use the **Test Player** button to verify the Plexamp connection and **Test Server** to verify the Plex server connection.

### Strip Configuration

Each dial panel can be configured independently:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Display Mode** | Artist, Album, Track Title, or Time |
| **Font Size** | Small (12) through XX-Large (28) |
| **Dial Action** | None, Next/Previous (rotate), or Volume (rotate) |
| **Dial Press** | Play/Pause, Toggle Shuffle, or Cycle Repeat |
| **Total Panels** | How many panels share the progress bar (1–4) |
| **Panel Position** | This panel's position in the progress bar sequence, or None to disable |
| **Text Color** | White, Light Gray, Orange, Amber, or Black |
| **Dynamic Colors** | When enabled, accent colors are extracted from album art. When disabled, they stay orange. |

For example, to have the progress bar span all 4 dials: set each panel to "4 panels" and positions 1, 2, 3, 4 from left to right.

### Advanced Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Time Offset** | Compensates for network latency between the player and the display. Defaults to 0ms. Only needed if the time display feels ahead or behind. |
| **Debug Logging** | When enabled, logs detailed API requests and connection state to the browser console. Plex tokens are automatically sanitized in log output for safe sharing. |

## Finding Your Plex Token

1. Open Plex Web (app.plex.tv) in your browser
2. Play any media
3. Press **F12** to open developer tools
4. Go to the **Network** tab
5. Look for any request and find `X-Plex-Token` in the URL
6. Copy the token value

For more details, see the [Plex support article](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Plugin not showing in actions list | Make sure Stream Deck was fully closed before running `install.bat` or `install.sh` |
| Player test fails | Verify Plexamp is running and the Player URL is correct. Headless Plexamp defaults to port 32500. Desktop Plexamp may use a different port. |
| Server test fails | Verify your server URL includes the port (`:32400`) and your token is correct |
| Buttons not working | This is usually a connection issue. Enable debug logging and check the browser console (`http://localhost:23654`) for errors. |
| Nothing displays | Confirm Plexamp is actively playing. Check both Player and Server test buttons. |
| Time display is off | Adjust the Time Offset in Advanced settings (try small values like 500–1000) |
| Progress bar not aligned | Check that all strip panels have matching Total Panels values |

### Debug Logging

If something isn't working, enable **Debug Logging** in the Advanced section of any Ampdeck action's settings. Then open the Stream Deck remote debugger at `http://localhost:23654` in your browser to see detailed logs. Plex tokens are automatically masked in log output, so it's safe to share logs when reporting issues.

## Manual Installation

Copy the `com.rackemrack.ampdeck.sdPlugin` folder to:

**Windows:**
```
%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins\
```

**macOS:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/

Then restart Stream Deck.
